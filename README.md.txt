CPSC 335 Project: Comparative Analysis and Visualization of Sorting Algorithms in Python
---

Goal is to create a tool to measure the execution time of each algorithm (Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort,
Counting Sort, Radix Sort, Bucket Sort, and Quick Select), and compare them across different array sizes.
---

This Project uses the libraries PySide6, matplotlib, time, sys, and random 

How the libraries are used: 
PySide6 - For building the GUI (Qt for Python)
matplotlib - For plotting graphs and visualizations
time - To measure how long the algorithms take to complete
sys - Allows Qt to handle command line args
random - Generate random numbers for the array
